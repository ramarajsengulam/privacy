At Aathira, we are committed to providing high-quality Magento 2 extensions while ensuring the utmost privacy and security for our users. This Privacy Policy describes how our extensions interact with your store data.

1. Information We Do Not Collect
Our extensions are designed to be self-contained within your Magento ecosystem.

No Remote Storage: We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), customer data, or order details from your Magento store to our external servers.

No Tracking: Our extensions do not include any hidden tracking scripts, "phone home" mechanisms, or analytics that monitor your admin or customer behavior.

2. Data Processing Within Magento
All data processing performed by our extensions happens locally on your web server.

Any information handled (such as log entries, configuration settings, or UI display data) remains strictly within your Magento database and file system.

3. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share, sell, rent, or lease any information from your store to third parties. Since we do not collect your data, there is no data to share.

4. Security Standards
We adhere to Magento’s Official Coding Standards and security best practices. Our extensions are built to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities into your Magento installation. We recommend that store owners always use the latest version of our extensions for the best security.

5. Cookies
Our extensions do not use or set any additional cookies on your storefront or admin panel unless it is a core requirement for the extension’s functionality (e.g., persistent cart features), which will be clearly documented in the user manual.

6. Changes to This Policy
AathiraSoft reserves the right to update this policy as we release new extensions or updates. Any changes will be updated on this page with a new "Last Updated" date.
